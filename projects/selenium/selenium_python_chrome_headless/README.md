# Overview
A very simple script that uses the Python selenium package to take a screenshot from cloudavail.com. Of interesting note this script runs chrome in "headless" mode which removes the dependency for tools such as Xvfb.

# To Run
1. Type `vagrant up`
2. Vagrant will run a shell script which will install all Python selenium requirements.
3. A small python script will take a screenshot.
