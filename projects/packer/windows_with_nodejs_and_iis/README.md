# Create the Packer Build VPC

This step assumes you've created a "Packer Build VPC" and made available the `$PACKER_VPC_ID` and `$PACKER_SUBNET_ID` variables.

# Run Packer

Validate the Packer File:
`packer validate windows_with_nodejs_script.json`

Create an AMI:

`packer build windows_with_nodejs_script.json`
